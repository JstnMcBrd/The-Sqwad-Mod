# PLANS FOR NEXT UPDATE
- make MacThuggo a republic of sorts?

***

# FUTURE PLANS
- Custom Music
- Sqwad Governments
- Religion
- Sqwad Decisions
- Sqwad Events
- Sqwad Mission Trees

- Perhaps more Sqwad nations?

***

# MUSIC
- perhaps let each person add a song?
- problem: not all songs would match very well with EU4
- problem: some may choose inappropriate songs
- problem: EU4 only accepts .ogg songs - how to convert to that format?
- decision: keep old EU4 music as well?

***

# SQWAD GOVERNMENTS
- problem: don't understand how to customize gov'ts anymore, needs research
	
***

# RELIGION
- should Tersia and MacThuggo be Protestant?
	- if so, I don't want to edit each province file to add Protestantism
	- all Catholic provinces would give them 0% religious unity
	- perhaps add Tersia- and MacThuggo-only decision to convert all to Protestant?

# SQWAD DECISIONS
- _Create a New Server_
	- _this decision would have to be created after the Desmond nation is added and all Sqwad nations are added as custom tributaries_
	- _available when development and prestige is higher than current server admin_
	- _removes custom tributary statis_
	- _gives CB to old server admin_
	- _sends event to all other Sqwad nations to decide whether to_
		- _join the new server and stay in their old one	#impossible_
			- _get added as a custom tributary for the new server admin as stays as a custom tributary for the other_
			- _small + relations for both server admins_
		- _join the new server and leave their old one_
			- _get added as a custom tributary for the new server admin and removed as a custom tributary for the old server admin_
			- _big + relations for new server admin_
			- _big - relations for old server admin and gives a CB_
		- _don't join the new server_
			- _big - relations for new server admin_
			- _big + relations for old server admin_

# CUSTOM SUBJECT TYPE
- _create a new subject type called "server member" that copies from tributary_
- _overlord called "server admin"_
- _"server members" can have multiple overlords	#impossible_
- _forceable by war_
- _gives tribute and #prestige# to overlord	#prestige impossible_
- _have all Sqwad nations start as "server member"s of Desmond, if he exists_
- _make is so only Sqwad nations can participate in this subject type (is_sqwad_nation_trigger = yes)_
- _add diplomatic actions to request to "join server"_

# SQWAD EVENTS
- 'Sqwad Diplomacy' Event
	- erases all alliances/rivalries between the Sqwad nations
	- reduces all opinions between Sqwad nations to -200
	- gives free cb on all other Sqwad nations
	- gives them cores on all of each others' countries? or maybe temporary claims?
	- see how diplomacy goes
- Big War
	- maybe just an event that triggers a war between all the Sqwad nations
	- problem: how to divide up the Sqwad nations?

- An event between M0P and E0B/J0M/desmond that uses these quotes?
	- "All mighty Lucy, I speak upon you to bestow upon me the wonders and glories of being admin... with your infinite wisdom this should be no problem convincing the other wise gods on your council in favor of me elevating to your stature. Over the years I have learned many lessons of how to properly and effectively guide a discord server to the ultimate glory, and with your guidance my lord I will be able to complete my training and become a admin on the most prestiges of servers."
	- "And to you the all Mighty McThuggin I have learned greatly from the many years which I have been honored to be in your presence. I am truly blessed to even be considered one of your acquaintances, let alone a friend. Please with your mighty powers I wish for you to cast your vote in favor of me being an admin on this fine server which you lead."
	- "Finally to you Desmond Weaver of webs you have truly weaved an intricate web of alliances and enemies, but due to this political excellence you have surrounded yourself with the victors and have therefore become one yourself.  Please consider making me an admin of your glorious server we all call home, it would truly be an honor."
	- "For MrThuggin you are infallible Im sorry I could have questioned you in the last comment, for that I am truly sorry; I question if you will ever be able to forgive me for this grave mistake. This question keeps me up all day and all night, please if it is not too much to ask for put my mind at ease."
	- perhaps gain some sort of favor from E0B/J0M/desmond?
