# Requirements for Sqwad Nations

- Every Sqwad nation is large enough that they are major powers and lead the politics of the area (influential)
- The Sqwad nations are bunched close enough together to interact regularly
- Each Sqwad nation centers around a major region, like inner Spain, Cisalpine Gaul, Denmark, south England, Austria, north Germany, Sweden, etc
- Sqwad nations aren't so large that there's no room for initial expansion to gain an advantage over other nations
- Sqwad nations are all reasonably balanced with each other
